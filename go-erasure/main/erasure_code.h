/**
 *  @file erasure_code.h
 *  @brief Interface to functions supporting erasure code encode and decode.
 *
 *  This file defines the interface to optimized functions used in erasure
 *  codes.  Encode and decode of erasures in GF(2^8) are made by calculating the
 *  dot product of the symbols (bytes in GF(2^8)) across a set of buffers and a
 *  set of coefficients.  Values for the coefficients are determined by the type
 *  of erasure code.  Using a general dot product means that any sequence of
 *  coefficients may be used including erasure codes based on random 
 *  coefficients.
 *  Multiple versions of dot product are supplied to calculate 1-6 output
 *  vectors in one pass.
 *  Base GF multiply and divide functions can be sped up by defining
 *  GF_LARGE_TABLES at the expense of memory size.
